**IS curve**
Goods market equilibrium
$$Y=C(Y-E)+I(r)+G$$
 Y = income $\quad$ C = consumption $\quad$ E = expenditure $\quad$ I = interest $\quad$ r = interest rate

$E=C+I(r_1)+G$
IS-LM model

Fiscal policy impact on the IS curve
Kansian curve
- changes in government spending
    With changes in G, the IS line shifts vertically
- changes in taxes
    If the margin to consume is 1 $\Delta T$, it doesn't change otherwise


*The theory of liquidity preference*
Supply of real money balance is fixed $(M/P)^d=L(r)$

You want liquidity(cash) when
- many transactions to carry
- emergencies and insurances
- speculations of point price (negative relationship with interest rate)


Income raising, demand of liquidity increases
**LM curve** money equilibrium

IS shocks: exogenous changes in the demand of goods & services
LM shocks: exogenous changes in the money market

IS policies
- Government spending G
- Tax revenue T
LM policies
- Money supply M

Raise in income is lower than the shift in the IS curve because
Raise in money supply lowers interest rate that increased investment causing income to rise

In the real world, Banks adjust M in response to changes in fiscal policy 

1. Hold M constant
2. Hold r constant
3. Hold Y constant

Why does the Central Bank target interest rates instead of the money supply?
1. Easier to measure
2. More efficient

IS-LM aggregate demand
Short run when the price level is assumed fixed
A changes in P would shift the LM curve therefore Y
**Aggregate demand curve** (AD) captures the relationship between P and Y
Aggregate supply
